	<h1>We built the company that we'd want to do business with. We hope you do too.</h1>
	<div class="column">
		<div class="chapter">1</div>
			<div class="title">Useful is forever</div>
			<p>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.</p>
		<div class="chapter">2</div>
			<div class="title">Great service is everything</div>
			<p>We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.</p>
		<div class="chapter">3</div>
			<div class="title"> Clarity is king</div>
			<p>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.</p>
		<div class="chapter">4</div>
			<div class="title">Our customers are our investors</div>
			<p>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.</p>
	</div>	
	<div class="column2">
		<div class="chapter">5</div>
			<div class="title">The basics are beautiful</div>
			<p>We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.</p>
		<div class="chapter">6</div>
			<div class="title">No hidden fees or secret prices</div>
			<p>We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.</p>
		<div class="chapter">7</div>
			<div class="title">Software should be easy</div>
			<p>Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.</p>
		<div class="chapter">8</div>
			<div class="title">Long-term contracts are obscene</div>
			<p>No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.</p>
